# AWS-BigData-Certification-pointers
This is the notes I prepared while studying and researching for AWS Big Data certification. I intend to make it more user-friendly with additional notes one day.

My two cents: To know every topic in the exam deeply enough is a long shot. But if you know two or three areas deeply, it should balance out the complicated exam questions from other areas. I had a deep interest in Redshift and DynamoDB, so that saved me. If you're preparing for AWS Big Data Specialty, best wishes!
